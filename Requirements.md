# Purpose #

Searching online for a quick solution to building a chess game in Flash lead me to no real good long term solutions.  This forced me to build a poorly designed solution that could not be scaled or extended.  After a few years I decided to create a framework to provide the basic functionality and framework to build complex and rich chess games in AS3.

# Requirements #

The initial requirements of the project including and not limited to the following:

  * Provide base functionality of the chess game
    * Piece Rules
    * Move Validation
    * Checkmate
    * Stalemate
  * Simple API
  * Allow extensible classes to allow developers to connect to chess servers and engines
  * Flexibility for chess variants and defining new piece movement rules
  * Move history

# Community Help #
Developers are needed to help support, maintain and extend the framework.  Future requirements include porting a chess engine into AS3 code for inclusion of OSAS3CF and creating bughouse chess extensions.
