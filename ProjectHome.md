# Open Source AS3 Chess Framework #
## Source code still under pre-release but available for review ##
Open Source AS3 Chess Framework provides a framework to build chess games in AS3 projects.  The framework provides features such as piece move enforcement, determining check, stalemate, en passant and move history.  The flexible framework is extensible to allow for connections to chess servers and engines as well as allowing other chess variants such as bughouse chess.
